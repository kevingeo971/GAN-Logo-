# GAN-Logo-
Using Generative Adverserial Networks to create Logos.

This is a project which involves training different GANS to generate LOGOs. The various methods that were tried out were : 
- Gradient Penalty
- Interpolation instead of Conv2D
- Weight clipping
- Conditional GAN's 
- Wasserstein Loss
- Different architectures 
- Training the generator more than the discriminator  

The best results were found using Gradient Clipping and training the generator more than the discriminator and the notebook for this is in the folder called best GAN.
